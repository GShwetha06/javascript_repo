1. Can we put duplicate values in the set object ?

    No

2. Write the syntax for
a) Creating new set object
b) Adding new element to set object
c) Deleting element from set object

    let set = new Set();

    set.add(5);
    set.add('Shwetha')
    set.add('a')

    set.delete('a');

3. Create a set object with four random numbers from 0 to 10. Check if this
newly created set object has 8 in it. Use set object methods.

    let set = new Set([1,3,5,8]);
    set.has(8);
